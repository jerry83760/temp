Kerberos 
This is a ticket based authentication protocol named after a mythical 3 headed dog, in this protocol the user do not needs to provide the password every time ,  this is centralized authentication
3 components are required:
	a. Client
	b. Service
	c. Key Distribution Center (KDC) usually DC and have Authentication Server (AS) and Ticket Granting Service (TGS)
	
	Working:
		a. Client sends a request for TGT to AS called KRB_AS_REQ (Keberos Authentication Service Request), this request contains the name of the client and timestamp of that request is encrypted with the NTLM hash of that client's password.
		b. Then AS decrypts that request with the client's NTLM hashed password and verifies it that the request is coming from where it claims to be, then it sends a TGT encrypted with krbtgt user NTLM hashed password called KRB_AS_REP
		c. Now, clients wants to use a service CIFS or SERVER01 for that it will send his encrypted TGT asking for a TGS ticket of that service called KRB_TGS_REQ
		d. KDC will decrypt that TGT and verifies, after validation KDC sends an TGS ticket encrypted with service NTLM hashed password to client called KRB_TGS_REP
		e. Client sends the TGS ticket to the service (CIFS or SERVER01) then service decrypts that TGS with its own secret called Application Request (KRB_AP_REQ)
