Session Hijacking vs Session Fixation

Session Fixation:
	• Goal: Set a session ID before the victim logs in.
	• How it works: Attacker tricks victim into using a session ID they already know.
	• Example: Attacker sends a link with a pre-set session ID. Victim logs in and the attacker gains access.
Session Hijacking:
	• Goal: Steal an active session ID.
	• How it works: Attacker captures an existing session ID to impersonate the victim.
	• Example: Attacker intercepts session ID via MITM attack or sniffing.
Key Differences:
	• Fixation: Attacker sets the session ID.
	• Hijacking: Attacker steals the session ID.
